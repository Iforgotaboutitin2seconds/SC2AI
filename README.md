Goal: Develop a self-learning AI for Starcraft 2.
Development Environment: Visual Studio will be used for coding.
Resources: Multiple AI learning resources will be consulted for troubleshooting and guidance.
Current Implementation: All code is contained within a single Python file named train_sc2_ai.py.
Execution: Running train_sc2_ai.py will initiate the AI training process.
Simplicity: The current implementation prioritizes simplicity by keeping all code in one file. (This imply a future plan to modularize the code as it grows.)
